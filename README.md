# Employee Directory

## Overview

For this assignment, I created a employee directory with React.

## User Story

- As a user, you will be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

The user will be able to:

- Sort the table by the category

- Filter the users by the property.

- Filter out by type in the letters. i.e: Type in letter "d" will show all the list contains letter "d"
